# Supervised Conversion from Landsat-8 Images to Sentinel-Images with Deep Learning

This is the official code for the paper titled "**Supervised Conversion from Landsat-8 Images to Sentinel-Images with Deep Learning**."

Dependencies:
- GDAL==3.0.0
- h5py==2.9.0
- torch==1.1.0
- torchvision==0.3.0


The dataset can be downloaded [here](http://bdsrc.binus.ac.id/wawan/l8s2/dataset). Put the dataset in the directory named "dataset" at the same level as the code directory.

To train a model, run this command:

```
python main.py -m [MODEL NAME]
```

The model name options are: "substride", "submax", "transstride", and "transmax".

To calculate the performance of each model, put the model_path.pth file generated by the training code the directory named as the corresponding model name in the save directory. Afterward, run this command:

```
python calculate_performance.py
```

To generate the predicted images as attached in the paper, download and extract this [file](http://bdsrc.binus.ac.id/wawan/l8s2/sample_image_s2.zip), then run this command:

```
python predict.py
```

The predicted images in tif format can be downloaded [here](http://bdsrc.binus.ac.id/wawan/l8s2/sample-tifs).
